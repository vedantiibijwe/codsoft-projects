CodSoft Internship Projects

📄 Task 1 - "Number Guessing Game"
In this project, you will develop an interactive Number Guessing Game using a programming language using java. The system will generate a random number within a specified range, and the player must guess it. The game should provide feedback such as "Too High" or "Too Low" to guide the user. The goal is to enhance logic building, user interaction handling, and basic control structures.

📁 Task 2 - "Student Grade Calculator"
This task involves creating a Student Grade Calculator, where users can input their marks for different subjects, and the system calculates the total percentage and corresponding grade (A, B, C, etc.). The project should follow a clear grading system and ensure proper input validation to prevent incorrect data entry.

🧮 Task 3 - "ATM Interface"
For this task, you will design an ATM Interface that simulates banking operations such as Withdraw, Deposit, Balance Inquiry, and Exit. It should incorporate secure storage for account balances, error handling for invalid transactions, and a user-friendly menu-driven interface. This project helps strengthen understanding of real-world financial systems and secure data handling.

📝 Task 4 - "Quiz Application with Timer"
This project focuses on developing a Quiz Application with a Timer, where users answer multiple-choice questions within a set time limit. The application should include features like question navigation, score calculation, and time tracking to simulate an actual quiz experience. 

📚 Task 5 - "Student Course Registration System"
In this task, you will develop a Student Course Registration System, allowing students to register for courses based on availability and prerequisites. The system should include features like course selection, student enrollment, database storage, and conflict checking to ensure smooth registration. This project improves database handling, form validation, and backend logic implementation.
